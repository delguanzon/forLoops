## Tests

` Describe: countByUp()
Test: "It should return null for empty values"
Code: countToNumber = ""
      countByNumber = ""
      countByUp(countToNumber, countByNumber)
Expected Output: null

Test: "It should return 0 for non-numerical values"
Code: countToNumber = "a"
      countByNumber = "b"
      countByUp(countToNumber, countByNumber)
Expected Output: 0


Test: "It should return 0 for negative numbers"
Code: countToNumber = -1
      countByNumber = -1
      countByUp(countToNumber, countByNumber)
Expected Output: 0

Test: "It should return 0 if the count by number larger than count to numbers"
Code: countToNumber = 2
      countByNumber = 5
      countByUp(countToNumber, countByNumber)
Expected Output: 0

Test: "It should take two numbers, one to count to and another to determine what multiple to use to get there"
Code: countToNumber = 5
      countByNumber = 20
      countByUp(countToNumber, countByNumber)
Expected Output: 5, 10, 15, 20 `
